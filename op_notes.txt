Convert to operation from stack.py in pystxm:
[ ] structure different stack methods in operations/workflows on different stages --> how will they be used, how is data read in (single frames, stacks etc...)
[?] getIOmask
[ ] calcOD



Workflows:
[ ] map - calc diff map
[ ] do we need sobel filter as extra operation?



Questions:
- better to process data directly or to create a new array/list etc? (e.g. [i] vs append in loop?)
- do we create copies? or just calc changes to apply to raw frames?
- do we need to wrap sobel filter?


@David: Overlap with utils.image.py
